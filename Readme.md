How to run the Colab :
1.Download the .ipynb from the Colab (File → Download → Download .ipynb).
2.Upload it to your own Google Drive (or open it directly in Colab).
3.You can now edit and run it freely.
4.Outputs from the original author will not be preserved unless they saved them in markdown or text in the notebook.
5.If the code requires data from the original author’s Google Drive, APIs, or local paths, you’ll need access to those for it to work. For this colab you need serp api key and open api key configuration before executing the commands.
